      and came to know about this awesome place with a beautiful cause from a friend of mine.</p>
      
    <p>This cafe is best suited for students, as it’s a great place to hang out, chill, and 
      enjoy cheap food while chipping in a great cause. Other than that,
       you can do some university stuff in this soothing atmosphere.</a></p>
